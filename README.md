Christmas â€™18 proof of concept to migrate one of my (older) local workflows from MAMP (Stack: PHP with MYSQL) to Docker.

# Basics

- __Dockerfile__: A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image.
- __Docker compose__: is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. And defines the services that make up your app in `docker-compose.yml` so they can run together in an isolated environment. Gets an app running in one command by just running `docker-compose up`... (after `docker-compose build`).

#### Find IPAddress

- `docker ps`
- `docker inspect <container id> | grep "IPAddress"`

### Start (with Docker Compose)

- Navigate to folder with: `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose build`
- `docker-compose up`
- Go to your fav. database tool and login localhost:3306 to init the database.

##### Start silently & Shutdown

- `docker-compose up -d` starts containers, detaches tty
- `docker-compose down` stops containers
